# Restangular-Example
Simple Angular/Restangular App that interacts with dummy json data

# Where to find the app
Look in src/js to find the posts posts module and the main app module: rwdApp.

This is a really simple start, but it could be a good place to tinker. As you already have the data coming in for the posts.
